# Daily Hiatus Journal
Hey! Spax here. This repository is meant to act as proof of me still existing for people who only know me online, as well as a bit of a daily reflection for myself about what I accomplished each day.

I don't know how often I'll use this repository (honestly I hope it's only this once) but I'll explain the reason for my current hiatus here:

# Reason for my hiatus
I fucked up. A lot. Out of embarrassment, I don't really want to reveal the most about how much I fucked up, but afterwards I can explain the full story. In a nutshell, I neglected so many of my classes this year of high school (senior year) that I have more than fully jeopardized my graduation. Now, I need to "fucking lock in" (as my irl put it) and get a semester's worth of work done in, *checks watch*, a bit under three weeks (currently writing this the evening of April 28th). This sorta means that I have an EXTREMELY small amount of time to do my shit, and it also means that I have close to no time on non-academic things (hence, the hiatus).

# How this will work
Even though I just said I don't have that much time to work with, I *do* think that writing about what I did every day is a good idea, not only so you guys know I'm okay, but so that I can really lay out my time in a semi-tangible form, dump my thoughts, etc. Is this an open journal? Idk. Will I continue this? Idk. We'll see.

I'm gonna organize this repository by `Month/Day.md`, so today, April 28th, will be `april/28.md`.

You can see the latest commits [here](https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/Daily-Hiatus-Journal/commits/main/), and if you want to be notified for updates on my status, just watch the repo from the top right (I'll be honored if you do this).

# Conclusion I guess
Thank you for checking in on me! I genuinely really appreciate it. If you need to contact me and it's low urgency, just open a [github issue](https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/Daily-Hiatus-Journal/issues) with whatever you need and I'll respond when I can (closed = answered). If it's high urgency, email `spiritaxolotl` at gmail.

Last thing: if you see me online on Discord or some other form of social media while I'm still on hiatus, give me a slap and tell me to get back to work!
