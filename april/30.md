New day! Rise and grind gamers ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

Okay, in all honesty, I'm not too happy about my productivity after school yesterday. Even with my reminder, I spent a lot of my time in the afternoon watching youtube. I've put the 30 minute "take a break" reminder to 15 minutes now, and I'll see if that helps. If not, I'll delete youtube too (and encourage myself to not use it on desktop).

I'm in sociology now and I'm planning on doing the current work for the class today instead of blowing it off in favor of \[miscellaneous computer thing\].

Seems like today is a late work day actually so I have about half an hour to work on everything in this class.

## 9:45am
Before class ended I set up a meeting with my sociology teacher, which will be in 15 minutes. I'm gonna see if he's still allowing late work from me for quarter 3, and if he isn't, I'm fucked. I really hope this meeting goes well.

Making a bit more progress on the stats work. I'll start on more sociology after I get halfway.
