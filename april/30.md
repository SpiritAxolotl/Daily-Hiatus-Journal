# April 30th

## 7:30am
New day! Rise and grind gamers ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

Okay, in all honesty, I'm not too happy about my productivity after school yesterday. Even with my reminder, I spent a lot of my time in the afternoon watching youtube. I've put the 30 minute "take a break" reminder to 15 minutes now, and I'll see if that helps. If not, I'll delete youtube too (and encourage myself to not use it on desktop).

I'm in sociology now and I'm planning on doing the current work for the class today instead of blowing it off in favor of \[miscellaneous computer thing\].

Seems like today is a late work day actually so I have about half an hour to work on everything in this class.

## 9:45am
Before class ended I set up a meeting with my sociology teacher, which will be in 15 minutes. I'm gonna see if he's still allowing late work from me for quarter 3, and if he isn't, I'm fucked. I really hope this meeting goes well.

Making a bit more progress on the stats work. I'll start on more sociology after I get halfway.

## 10:15am
My teacher was in the middle of teaching a lesson so I think he meant 11 not 10. Resuming stats now.

On a separate note, the fucking shock on my face when I saw a FORK of this repo <img alt="loam" width="15px" height="15px" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1029242001356492800.png">. I appreciate it, but forks are closed. If I make a mistake on here, I'll probably notice it and fix it on my own. If it's something very important though, just email me. But yea from here on out I'll be closing all prs that get opened (hopefully this is the only one lmao).


## 10:30pm
Quite a jump in time! Spent the next period doing some graphic design work for a class and then physics. I started working on more of the statistics and then got distracted with css fixes for a website that [ended up as a github pull request](https://github.com/peterhanania/Discord-Package/pull/143) ðŸ’€. I also got distracted by my discord data export, and in doing so, also my external storage. This post feels a bit rambly whoops.

That discord :loam: emote I used two paragraphs above this? Had to get it from my package since I couldn't find it on google and I wasn't gonna log into discord. ~~And if you're reading this right now, you'll see that I didn't even get the emote!~~<sup title="yeah ended up getting those right before committing these changes. might host them on this repo in an assets folder but we'll see">[?]</sup> My external hard drive unplugged from my computer somehow and now it's not being recognized :(. It's done this a few dozen times over the years and genuinely the best thing I can really do is just leave it plugged in and hope my mac repairs it automatically. If for some reason it's too long gone, I'll send it to seagate to see if they can recover the data for me, but I'm crossing my fingers it doesn't come to that. i REALLY need a backup backup; this shit happens too often.

That aside, an interesting series of events took place over the last two days. One of my irls was giving away a shit ton of tech stuff he owned (I don't know why he was doing this but I don't question). He kept asking on a groupchat I'm on with a dozen other people what everyone wanted, and it was a first-come-first-serve type situation. Two days ago, he was giving away _a full monitor_, alongside a mount, keyboard, mouse, and some other USB-related cables and accessories. Granted, it wasn't very modern techâ€“probably 2010-era stuff, but I said to myself "fuck it, I could use a second display" and took him up on his offer. The next day, he came to school with A HUGE FUCKING BOX THAT LOOKED LIKE A BOMB, which was MODERATELY HEAVY. I will upload a picture of what it looked like later, but holy FUCK as funny as that thing was to carry around it was so embarrassing. Glad I got it closer to the end of the day.

SPONTANEOUS UPDATE: THE HARD DRIVE REPAIRED ON ITS OWN WOOOOOO

So yeah, I took the box with me on the bus ride home, and got it to my house safely. I put it in the corner of my room and resumed schoolwork, thinking I would set it up on the weekend. Fast forward to today where I decided to set it up _now_ for some reason. Took me 15 minutes to just _unwrap_ it because holy hell. He wrapped everything in bubble wrap, some sort of beige tape, and zipties. Once everything was unwrapped (and I realized that I had to _mount_ it), I then had to spend like another 15 minutes figuring out _where_ to mount it, and I decided on this office space close to my room. I spent a good half an hour clearing the desk and fastening the clamp thing to the desk, and then it was basically set up. I plugged in the HDMI cables and it worked well! I haven't been able to use a second monitor since the summer, so I'm really glad I got my hands on another now.  
All-in-all, it probably took me about an hour to set up, but I think it was worth it. Unrelated but I broke a part of the table I mountedâ€“because I put close to my full weight on it and it busted a part that held two of the parts together. I just gotta move it to a different section of the connection and it'll be fine though. It seems to be doing okay also, but I don't wanna wait more than a few days to actually properly fix it. Oh well.

Okay, now jumping back to the external hard drive stuff. Basically, a couple years ago I got a 5 terabyte hard drive for storing shit. It's hard to describe its size but it's basically a thicker and shorter phone. When it repaired itself a few minutes ago-

Okay my computer told me it ran out of application memory and then froze and then restarted and now my external hard drive did the thing again so that's fun. I love technology <img alt="grinn" width="15px" height="15px" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1226626435356299356.png">.

So yeah, when it repaired itself like 15 minutes ago but before it spontaneously stopped working again, I saw that I had used up exactly half of the total storage capacity: 2.5 TB. Just thought that was interesting.

At some point in the day today, I realized "wait I'm not gonna have access to my school email's stuff once I graduate" so I went to [google takeout](https://takeout.google.com) and requested a full data export. A couple hours ago, I got the email about my data being ready to download. 240 GB spread across five `.tgz` files. Convenient for the files being in bulk, but also not really because downloading five near-50 GB files is kinda not really fun in the slightest. My internet already shat itself once while I was trying to download them soon after, so I really hope I pull off this download before the export expires. This also requires that my external hard drive works so that I can download the files to it. Might just have to do it tomorrow after school if it doesn't repair itself again in the next few minutes.

Unrelated again but passover ended this evening! I can eat bread again :3  
A part of my soul dies whenever I use that.

All-in-all, this afternoon has been very productive in terms of non-academics. Fortunately not youtube doomscrolling or other actual time wasters. Still, I gotta get my act together on the work I need to do and the reason I'm on this fucking hiatus in the first place. Plan for tomorrow: fully finish the statistics assignment (or get a significant amount of it done), get at least 4 late sociology assignments in OH MY GOD THERE'S A TEST IN TWO DAYS I HAVE TO STUDY TOMORROW FUCKKKKKK. Okay whatever I'll study for the test and try to get the assignments for the current unit done.

I also have to cram AP CSA review since I'm taking the exam in a week and i REALLY want a 5 (last year I got a 4â€“to my disappointment). Gotta get inheritance down.

OK THE HARD DRIVE REPAIRED ITSELF AGAIN. THANK. FUCK. AUgH.....

I think that's enough writing for today. It's actually 11:30pm now if that gives you a better idea of how long it takes to write these. Some people might say that writing these is a waste of time and I should be doing schoolwork instead, but (as I think I've said before) I think it helps me sort my thoughts in a more tangible form and reflect on what I actually accomplished each day.

I'm also gonna quickly get the discord emotes for the two times I used them above. Okay done, that took like five minutes but it felt like a lot longer. It's 11:55pm now!

Okay bye chat! And until next year, April. o7
