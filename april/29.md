# April 29th

## 8:00am
Got three hours of sleep last night. Had a strong cup of coffee this morning (I'm still so tired) and grinded out one more problem for that statistics assignment. I turned it in about half an hour ago, and my teacher was very pleased.
I'm spending the class period watching videos from one of our web apps and filling out guided notes. Shouldn't be too hard, but yesterday I found [a video about a file organization program someone made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTQeMkYRMcw) (which is [open source](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio)) and I need to keep myself from thinking about it.

I might need to just give myself a small sliver of time to do the things that I actually enjoy doing. On the other hand, the ride on the bus already makes for this pretty well. It's two 20-30 minute periods every weekday.  
Yeah maybe making a schedule will be a good idea.

Oh yeah I added a "Back/Next" thing to the bottom of these pages. Idk how I should really format them but I can probably fix them all pretty easily with some regex.
