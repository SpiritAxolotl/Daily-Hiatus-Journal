Yep. I was sick. Coughing up tons of phlegm and my body was sore for the entire day (didn't help that I got injured TWICE today (long story (no not a fight))). I also wore a mask to school so everyone knew lmao. Oh well. This won't be a fun few days.

Work done today? Close to none, unfortunately. I got absolutely deadset on recreating a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/Phantom_TheGame/1772750632958427149) on cohost, and [here's the chost](https://cohost.org/Spax/post/5900515-as-a-way-to-enco) and [here's the unobfuscated code](https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/Chosts/blob/main/chosts/gen-z/) (that I made yet another repo for lmfao). It also got a good laugh out of my classmates watching me make it in real time. Honestly most of the time was spent figuring out how to get it to show up properly because of cohost's stripping and sanitization (only inline css, no javascript, no css variables, a few banned html tags, no `position: fixed;`, no data uris, no bare SVGs, etc etc). Makes for some creative solutions though (also [prechoster](https://cloudwithlightning.net/random/chostin/prechoster/) and [codehost](https://codehost.wavebeem.com/) were a big help).

So yeah. No work done. Gonna make up for it tomorrow by getting most of that statistics packet done and then a ton of class remediation (maybe both at the same time?).

Sorry for these short posts lately! I'm still trying to write these daily and reflect on what I did during the day but I guess when other projects became distractions again this got less active. Tomorrow I'll try making more check-ins here.

Until then, I'm gonna have some tea to soothe my throat and then go to bed. Gnight chat!

*also FUCK I FORGOT TO POST JERMA FOR WEDNESDAY YESTERDAY*  
i'll do it next week augh  
it's there in spirit  
gotta set a reminder
