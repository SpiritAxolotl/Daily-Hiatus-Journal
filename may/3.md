Yes that's right it's 1pm before I wrote the next thing in here. I stayed up until 2 last night working on that script. I worked on it literally for 4 straight hours making it better (and then debugging it) (fetch requests augh). Right now it's in 1.6.2 and it can now be used as a userscript (or just pasted in the console), and I'm happy to take my hands off of it for a bit. I even made it a repo so others could work on it and improve it too (publicizing it soon).

Okay published!
