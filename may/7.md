I'm proud of myself today! I actually got a good chunk of remediation work done! I got a little over 20% done for government, and I only did it for a few hours. If I spent an entire day I could probably finish one to 100%. This is good pacing. I've got 60% of government done now and very close to 0% of financial literacy done, so if I kept at my current pace of +20% a day, I could get them both done in 8 days (which is two days before May 17th)! I'll try to get at least government done by friday.

I wrote these scripts to automate most of the stuff:

```js
//adding A) B) C) D) etc to the quiz options
function abcd() {
  const d = document.querySelector("iframe#stageFrame")?.contentWindow?.document?.querySelector("iframe#iFramePreview")?.contentWindow?.document ?? 
    document.querySelector("iframe#stageFrame")?.contentWindow?.document;
  if (d.querySelector("div.Practice_Question_Body")) {
    const answers = Array.from(d.querySelectorAll("div.answer-choice > label.answer-choice-label"));
    for (let i=0, j=0; i<answers.length; i++) {
      if (!answers[i].innerText.match(/^[A-Z]\)\s.*/g)) {
        answers[i].innerText = `${"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"[j]}) ${answers[i].innerText}`;
        j++;
      }
    }
    clearInterval(f);
  }
}
let f = setInterval(abcd, 1000);
document.querySelector("iframe#stageFrame")?.contentWindow?.
document?.querySelector("#nextQuestion")?.addEventListener("click", () => {
  f = setInterval(abcd, 1000);
});

//auto-advance videos and lessons
let g = setInterval(() => {
  const frame = document.querySelector("iframe#stageFrame");
  if (frame) {
    frame?.contentWindow?.API?.FrameChain?.nextFrame();
    const mutebutton = frame.document.querySelector("#icon-media-volume2");
    if (mutebutton)
      mutebutton.click();
  }
  else
    clearInterval(g);
  document.querySelector(".footnav.goRight")?.click();
}, 1000);
```

Navigating through iframes is not fun. Gonna eventually just make something that creates a variable called `alldocs` that just contains Everything. idk.

Oh, the script that I wrote for the government website broke lmfao. They changed their functions to consts so I can't overwrite them anymore ðŸ˜­. Spent a minute on a hotfix just now. I also got advice to private the repository, so I went ahead and did that. The userscript install is still public though.

Anyawys, the AP CSA exam is tomorrow. I got the day to study and do work so I'm probably gonna review inheritance and polymorphism briefly before it.

Going to bed at 11! Better than 3 lmao. Night chat.
