## 7:30am
Okay, that was one hell of an evening. Two of the downloads finished before I went to bed so I queued up the three remaining ones, but their downloads were aborted so I'm gonna try download them on school wifi now, one per period so I don't stress my school's wifi too much (because use of too muchbandwidth is actually one of their concerns apparently, which is why they blocked most streaming services).

Anyways, happy May! It's that one month where school feels very weird because it's so close to the end of the year. Except I'm gonna be spending it on literally mostly schoolwork and not goofing off like I used to. Fun!
