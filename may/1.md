Okay, that was one hell of an evening. Two of the downloads finished before I went to bed so I queued up the three remaining ones, but their downloads were aborted so I'm gonna try download them on school wifi now, one per period so I don't stress my school's wifi too much (because use of too muchbandwidth is actually one of their concerns apparently, which is why they blocked most streaming services).

Anyways, happy May! It's that one month where school feels very weird because it's so close to the end of the year. Except I'm gonna be spending it on literally mostly schoolwork and not goofing off like I used to. Fun!

I also forgot to share my nyt connections yesterday so here:

```txt

Okay I'm gonna put the rest of the bulk of nyt stuff I do today in here:

That took like 15 minutes total dw

Well, I spent the last 3 hours [working on my github profile](https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/SpiritAxolotl/tree/fd39964720d9569b9153e03577ffeae57030a370). On the one hand, it's a good laid-back resumé! On the other, I just spent 3 hours doing Not schoolwork and at this point I'm actually getting a bit worried about my time management even with taking social media out of the picture. I swear to god if I have to bar myself from working on any other github project.

But yeah, check it out if you want. I took inspiration from [Snazzah](https://github.com/Snazzah/Snazzah)'s and [jules](https://github.com/catfxngs/catfxngs)'s profiles, so I'd like to thank them both :3  

Now I'm gonna work on my current english work and then sociology. Then statistics if I have time.
