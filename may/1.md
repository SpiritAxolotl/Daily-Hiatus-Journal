# May 1st

## 7:30am
Okay, that was one hell of an evening. Two of the downloads finished before I went to bed so I queued up the three remaining ones, but their downloads were aborted so I'm gonna try download them on school wifi now, one per period so I don't stress my school's wifi too much (because use of too muchbandwidth is actually one of their concerns apparently, which is why they blocked most streaming services).

Anyways, happy May! It's that one month where school feels very weird because it's so close to the end of the year. Except I'm gonna be spending it on literally mostly schoolwork and not goofing off like I used to. Fun!

I also forgot to share my nyt connections yesterday so here:

That took like 15 minutes total dw

## 1:00pm
Well, I spent the last 3 hours [working on my github profile](https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/SpiritAxolotl/tree/fd39964720d9569b9153e03577ffeae57030a370). On the one hand, it's a good laid-back resumé! On the other, I just spent 3 hours doing Not schoolwork and at this point I'm actually getting a bit worried about my time management even with taking social media out of the picture. I swear to god if I have to bar myself from working on any other github project.

But yeah, check it out if you want. I took inspiration from [Snazzah](https://github.com/Snazzah/Snazzah)'s and [jules](https://github.com/catfxngs/catfxngs)'s profiles, so I'd like to thank them both :3  

Now I'm gonna work on my current english work and then sociology. Then statistics if I have time.

## 11:45pm
That english work ended up being a small essay that's due by tomorrow at 11:59pm, so I'll work on it tomorrow. I got a good chunk of sociology work done today, gonna finish it tomorrow for the sake of me who is very slowly falling asleep because oh my god im so tired.

Speaking of tires, I changed a tire today for my drivers license prep or whatever. That was fun but jeez it was chilly outside today.

Also, I decided to remove youtube from my phone because it was too distracting–go figure. I also have a chrome extension that lets you hide certain aspects of youtube's UI, so I configured it to hide recommended videos, the home feed, and notifications. Now I can only really use youtube if I have a direct link to a video. But yeah I gave youtube a few days and ultimately it just kept distracting me, so it had to go. It's unfortunate but whatever.

Okay, time for may 2nd. Night chat.
