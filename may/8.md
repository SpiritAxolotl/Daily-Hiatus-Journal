Wow! It was a big day today! I'm super tired right now but let me summarize today.

So if you have an AP test scheduled, you are excused from all of your classes that day. AP teachers usually forgive the work you miss because they get it, but the non-AP teachers usually don't lmao. Fortunately the work I had to do today in-class wasn't that much so I can do that tomorrow.

I decided to go to my first period because I wanted to finish the movie we were currently watching (*The Straight Story*) (no it's not a queer film), so after that period was over I went down to the classroom where my former programming teacher was, and decided to do a review for the two hours I had before the exam. I ended up reviewing inheritance a ton(parent/child classes, polymorphism, casting) (yeah fuck inheritance), and also decided to actually learn `String.compareTo()` because I kinda never really understood it (I still don't understand it ).

I started the test at about noon and because I have extended time (+50%), the test ended up being almost 5 hours long. 2:15 for both the MCQ and the FRQ, with a ten minute break in between, and I used up about 95% of the time for each. Now legally, I cannot actually discuss the contents of the test. Thanks collegeboard. However, I *will* say that I was prepared. I could answer every question confidently, and double-checked my answers to make sure I didn't make obvious mistakes. Also, I really hate how collegeboard words some of their questions?? I also hate how they kinda go against their own recommendations. Extremely generally, there was a question that set a parameter equal to something else, and it's like no??? don't touch the parameter??? just make another fucking variable oh my god. and with their wording, they just make it a "oh well Fuck it's a cs *and* an english test" and I feel like that's a huge flaw in a lot of tests, but especially AP ones. test us on our fucking knowledge, not advanced reading comprehension and reading between the lines. fuckers.

i HAVE to get a 5 or else I will be so mad.

Oh yeah, this is what my area looked like after the exam:

I must have used up an entire pencil's worth of erasers on that test. The free response is always brutal for me cuz ***handwritten code***. Shit is awful. I survived though.

So yeah, after the exam. I had texted my mom "taking the test now so I won't be available for a bit" before the test started and I turned my phone off shortly after. When the exam finished and I turned on my phone again, I was met with texts such as "Where are you?" "[Real name]!! What's happening?" "I'm a little worries. The test wouldn't have taken this long" (the test had taken that long). I guess I shouldn't have said "a bit"??? What was more annoying was that my watch (not a smartwatch but it had satellite data) had supposedly bricked and I couldn't turn it on after the test ended, which kinda sucked. Later this evening I got it on again though. Shit was at 10% but it hadn't died so idk.

Anyways, shortly after the exam, I went to an art exhibit my friend made art for. It was really nice! It was sorta a nice reward for finishing a 5 hour long AP test.

I also don't think I mentioned this anywhere yet but I took my CSA class last year and got a 4 on the test (to my dismay). Granted, I didn't study at all (because I was just programming in java anyways), and some people would say a 4 is good for that. Still, I decided to retake the test *this* year to get the 5 because i *REALLY* want to secure that score for the field I'm planning on going into.

Anways, (jeez I start a lot of paragraphs with that), I'm off to bed now. Night chat!

Oh uh, my throat has been feeling funny for the past 8ish hours, so I hope I'm not sick (either cuz of a virus or my body is just Done with me staying up super late).
