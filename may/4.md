**Yes that's right it's almost 10pm before I wrote the next thing in here.**

Yes, so let me update you on what I did today:
- Worked on the script from yesterday some more
- [Made a new thing on my website](https://spax.zone/tests/ooo)

That is LITERALLY it. I genuinely need to fucking get a grip. I've decided to get a relatively early night tonight instead of staying up until 1 or 2 and tomorrow I'm waking up at 8 to get more than half of my current sociology done by lunch. Is that unrealistic? Probably. But I'm giving myself no choice here.

Anyways happy star wars day. I think I've watched the first few movies like 3 or 4 times total and I still don't understand the plot. I remember the first time I watched the first few was during new years when I was like, 8, and I fell asleep during the second movie.  
I don't think I'll ever get into it. Plus, I'd rather get into star trek lmao.

I'm ending this very minimal post. Hyperfocus mode<sup>\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_needed)\]</sup> will be in overdrive tomorrow. My confidence is slowly receding. I hope I make it.
