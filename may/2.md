## 7:00am
Okay I forgot to share this fucking video that I was recommended a few hours before I deleted youtube yesterday:

<div align="center">
<a href="https://youtu.be/AawLM81gIHo"><img width="400px" alt="a youtube video titled &quot;playlist to study like a medieval philosopher having the truth revealed by divine grace&quot; and a medieval portrait as the thumbnail" src="./../assets/medieval-philosopher.png" /></a>
</div>

Sadly it's just the same hour of music looped a few times. Rahhhh I wanted 7 hours of unique midieval tracks chat this is so sad.  
...I'll still listen to it though.

So this morning I'm planning on finishing the rest of my sociology work for this unit in literally 30 minutes before class starts and I take my test. Hopefully I'll make it!

## 9:30am

Didn't make it, but got pretty damn close. I also talked with my teacher and he said that yes he is still accepting late work from me and I'm so thankful of that, because I feel like I mentioned here before that I would be FUCKED if I had to remediate that class too.

Anyways, NYT games speedrun any%

## 11:30pm
I ended up spending my lunch making [this connections puzzle](https://connections.swellgarfo.com/game/-NwuMNHm6xDpWsivrEji). Time not well spent but hey, now you can try to solve it!

## 8:00pm
Rest of the day went fine. I was in contact with one of my mentors because I put in an order for clothing and I got this picture today:

<div align="center">
<img height="400px" alt="a picture of a couple prints of the oven garfield copypasta" src="./../assets/ovens.png" />
</div>

So I feel like I need to give some context.  
First, I'm in an internship-esque class and each group was assigned a mentor who's experienced in whatever thing we're making, and we got this awesome dude who knows a lot about design, printing on clothing, AND he can print anything. He is so cool.  
Second, about this time last year, I decided to upscale the infamous ["why do they call it oven" copypasta](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d9a9cd1273745c5ff8b7cf4fd6c13b5c/4c47a3c8dec6434d-b8/s400x600/c763d2dcea748715c3ee5fc1e118533ca773bd93.png) so I could get it printed on a shirt or poster. After a bit of digging, I found a [higher quality version posted by the official Garfield twitter account](https://twitter.com/Garfield/status/1479531043443118081/photo/1), but the colors were significantly different than the original, the font was VERY different, and worst of all, it was cropped (although it did reveal more of the vertical which was cool). My photoshop skills aren't too bad, so I launched a new project, replaced all the colors with the original colors (or at least the average of them since it was dithered), and got 80% of the image restored. The only thing I needed was a wider crop and the font to be higher quality (since the fanmade garfield font doesn't actually fit the best). I tried AI (specifically waifu2x) soon after to try get the area outside the twitter crop, and found that it kinda felt off in some way, so I put off trying AI again until a few months ago. I decided to use it to upscale it to something that I could at least _work_ with, and the result I got by using [this](https://unlimited.waifu2x.net/) version of waifu2x actually didn't turn out half bad. I spent a few hours cleaning up the result and got something that was actually _really_ good. It wasn't perfect, like if you looked closely between the AI parts and the rest of it, you can tell a difference (or maybe it's just me), but it was good enough. I finally had a version of the image that was more than double the resolution.  
So I had an upscaled version of the image, and someone who could provide printing services. I told my mentor what exactly I wanted printed, so he gave me his ordering website and asked me to pick out what shirts I wanted it on. I gave him the link to two light gray shirts (for me and another irl who wanted it as a shirt as well), and he ordered the shirts. He then asked me what graphic I wanted printed, so I gave him the finished image.  
This was about a month ago. The picture that I posted above was sent to me today, and I'm expecting them to get pressed onto the shirts pretty soon. And as an added bonus, the shirts are so cheap. $9 per, which compared to most clothing nowadays, is a REALLY good deal.  
Also, there was actually a slight miscommunication with my mentor involving some "wrong" prints (because I sent him a version of the image with a white border instead of a transparent one), but it's fine because well just get two white shirts to print it on to make it look normal. And this means that I'll have a couple extra pairs to give out to some people who want them! I realize there's probably copyright issues or whatever but I think this is indie enough for it to be justifiable (and the fact that this would basically be an extremely limited run lmao). Yea just email me what shirt size you are and where I should mail it to. I'll charge ya $10 so that I can make a singular dollar in profit (I'll pay for shipping) but yeah if you're comfortable with all that you can have a super iconic and totally not dumb shirt too!  
I also forgot to mention that I asked [the person who made the original copypasta](https://twitter.com/YashichiDSF/status/373678745883639808) and [the person who edited it onto a garfield comic](https://www.tumblr.com/ewaneneollav/187152694453) (and her friend) if they wanted shirts, and the last two said sure (with the first one politely declining), so I'm printing some extras for them too.

Anyways, that's the oven story. I'll be releasing the PSD and all the related stuff at a later date once I've made absolutely sure that it is as good as it can be (what did I mean by this).

Moving onto actual schoolwork, I'm going to finish more of the stats notes and save the actual practice problem stuff. Yes I did spend like an hour writing that oven story. I am really not fucking good at managing my time <img width="16px" alt="shinji chair" src="./../assets/emotes/shinji.jpg" />.

Literally my goal tonight is get as much of the notes done as possible without exhausting myself and updating my teacher on the status of it so I don't leave her in the dark like last time. For tomorrow, I'm gonna dedicate it to as much class remediation as humanly possible.

Something else:

If you know you know or whatever.

But yeah, time to get back to work. I've already showered this evening so I don't have to worry about that for the rest of the night. I'll update the post when I head to bed.

## 11:45pm
No work got done for the rest of the evening. I found out that Utah passed a transphobic bathroom bill, and I saw that a ton of people were spamming its report form with the bee movie script and other copypastas, so I spent the last hour and a half writing this script:  
<https://gist.github.com/SpiritAxolotl/7d72c5222dc57b2be2b9002df917b6d2>  
Illegal? Yea probably but it's for the greater good (also internet comedy). I posted it on cohost too if you wanna rechost it <https://cohost.org/Spax/post/5817969-utah-passed-a-transp>

As great as it felt to write that, I can't help but notice the sheer amount of times I justify not working because of something else. It is at this point where I am getting genuinely worried if I can pull this off, restrictions and all. Should I keep restricting what I'm able to use? Will it just come down to me chaining myself to my desk and only keeping canvas or google docs open for me to get my work done?? God I hope I figure this out soon.

Goodnight.
