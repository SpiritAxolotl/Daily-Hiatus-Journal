Okay I forgot to share this fucking video that I was recommended a few hours before I deleted youtube yesterday:

<div align="center">
<a href="https://youtu.be/AawLM81gIHo"><img width="400px" alt="a youtube video titled &quot;playlist to study like a medieval philosopher having the truth revealed by divine grace&quot; and a medieval portrait as the thumbnail" src="./../assets/medieval-philosopher.png" /></a>
</div>

Sadly it's just the same hour of music looped a few times. Rahhhh I wanted 7 hours of unique midieval tracks chat this is so sad.  
...I'll still listen to it though.

So this morning I'm planning on finishing the rest of my sociology work for this unit in literally 30 minutes before class starts and I take my test. Hopefully I'll make it!
