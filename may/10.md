That ended up not happening. Time for a daily summary I guess.

So productivity! I actually got a good chunk of class remediation done and a full page of statistics notes, which is good! But I still need to pick up the pace, and my time spent on cohost is still increasing (I made quite a few posts today and I might hyperlink some stuff tomorrow).

Here's a novel idea for me: absolutely FORCE myself to not use cohost until I get a set amount of schoolwork done. This is a strategy people tell me to employ all the time, but it has never worked for me. Who knows, maybe it'll work this time?

Anyways, what else did I do today? Oh yeah, I asked Amber if I could briefly unarchive "woah its rex" so I could import my gitlab activity to it (so my github activity had more stuff in it) and she said yeah, so I imported it a few hours ago and now I don't have to think about how the hell I was gonna ask her.

I'm gonna head to bed now. Taking Nyquil because I'm still sick and have a headache. Probably will fall asleep to youtube. Night chat.
